INTRODUCTION For this project I wanted to see if there was a relationship between the condition of roads/infrastructure of each state and their corresponding GDP status for each year. The infrastructure data frame used in this assignment comes from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics â€“&amp;gt; https://www.bts.gov/road-condition . It originally had 5 columns, listing the state, international roughness index, class, year, and total miles.</description>
